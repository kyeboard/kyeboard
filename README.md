## Brace your fears! A Rustacean has spawned!

Konnichiwa! 
I am kyeboard, an average weekend lover, a frontend developer and a Rustacean! I love building awwsome CLI tools for the homies, blazingly fast! I have quite a liking for Rust, VueJs, TailwindCSS and windows (aye, not the sus Windows operating system!). In my free times, I usually make some YouTube videos on awesome open source projects or play games (Valoranto, wanna duo?). Sometimes, I do often mess up with Android devices, it is kinda fun. Lastly, I try solving some competitive questions on Leetcode :).
